# Image Classification RPS

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a classifier that can distinguish between images representing rock, paper, or scissors, based on a dataset. It uses Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and model training.

## Model Details
- Architecture: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Dataset: A custom dataset of rock, paper, and scissors images.
- Accuracy: Achieved an accuracy of 0.9783105254173279.

## Results
The model is capable of classifying images into the correct category with decent accuracy. Future improvements may include data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning, and experimenting with deeper architectures.
